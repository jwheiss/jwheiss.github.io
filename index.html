<p><i>Undergraduate and graduate students interested in coastal hydrogeology are encouraged to contact james_heiss@uml.edu for available research opportunities. Graduate studies are available through MS and PhD programs in the <a href="https://www.uml.edu/Sciences/EEAS/">Department of Environmental, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences</a> and the <a href="https://marine.massachusetts.edu/">University of Massachusetts Intercampus Marine Science Program</a>.</i></p>

<p>Research in the Hydrogeology Group at UMass Lowell is centered on groundwater-surface water and chemical exchanges along the land-sea margin. We integrate physical sciences (hydrology, coastal ocean processes, climate science) to investigate saltwater intrusion into aquifers, coupled human-natural coastline systems, coastal water resources, and aquifer biogeochemistry. We are currently exploring interactions between groundwater and waves, tides, currents, and sea level rise through field experimentation, numerical flow and reactive transport models, and quantitative synthesis of large datasets.</p>
