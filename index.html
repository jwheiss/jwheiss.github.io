<p>Research in the Hydrogeology Group at UMass-Lowell is centered on coastal groundwater-surface water exchanges groundwater resources. We integrate physical sciences (hydrology, coastal ocean processes, climate science) to investigate saltwater intrusion into aquifers, coastal water resources, benthic exchange, and aquifer biogeochemistry. We are currently exploring interactions between groundwater and waves, tides, currents, and sea level rise through field experimentation, numerical flow and reactive transport models, and quantitative synthesis of large datasets. Our research sites span the land-sea margin and include coastal watersheds, beaches, estuaries, and the continental shelf.</p> 

<p><i>Undergraduate and graduate students interested in coastal hydrogeology are encouraged to contact james_heiss@uml.edu for available research opportunities.
