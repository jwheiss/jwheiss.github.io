<p>I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with research focused on the role of terrestrial and oceanographic forcings on coastal groundwater dynamics.
</p>

<p>Biogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers can alter the fate and
fluxes of chemicals in groundwater before entering receiving coastal water bodies. These zones of reactivity are formed as a result of complex
groundwater flow, mixing, and solute transport processes that are driven by hydrologic forcings over a range of temporal and spatial scales. My research involves identifying the role of these 
forcings on impacting subsurface flow behavior and the 
distribution, fate, and fluxes of nutrients and other chemicals in coastal aquifers. I use a combination of field experiments and coupled
numerical groundwater flow and reactive transport models to investigate those processes.</p>
