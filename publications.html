			<p>A combined field and numerical study was conducted to investigate dynamics of subsurface flow and moisture response to waves in the swash zone of a sandy beach located on Cape Henlopen, DE. A density-dependent variably saturated flow model MARUN was used to simulate subsurface flow beneath the swash zone. Values of hydraulic conductivity (K) and characteristic pore size (?, a capillary fringe property) were varied to evaluate their effects on subsurface flow and moisture dynamics in response to swash motions in beach aquifers. The site-specific modeling results were validated against spatiotemporal measurements of moisture and pore pressure in the beach. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the hydraulic conductivity and capillary fringe thickness of the beach greatly influenced groundwater flow pathways and associated transit times in the swash zone. A higher value of K enhanced swash-induced seawater infiltration into the beach, thereby resulting in a faster expansion of a wedge of high moisture content induced by swash cycles, and a flatter water table mound beneath the swash zone. In contrast, a thicker capillary fringe retained higher moisture content near the beach surface, and thus, significantly reduced the available pore space for infiltration of seawater. This attenuated wave effects on pore water flow in the unsaturated zone of the beach. Also, a thicker capillary fringe enhanced horizontal flow driven by the larger-scale hydraulic gradient caused by tides.</p>

			<p>Marine ecosystems are sensitive to inputs of chemicals from submarine groundwater discharge. Tidally influenced saltwater-freshwater mixing zones in beach aquifers can host biogeochemical transformations that modify chemical loads prior to discharge. A numerical variable-density groundwater flow and reactive transport model was used to evaluate the physical controls on reactivity for mixing-dependent and mixing-independent reactions in beach aquifers, represented as denitrification and sulfate reduction, respectively. A sensitivity analysis was performed across typical values of tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, terrestrial freshwater flux, beach slope, dispersivity, and DOC reactivity. For the model setup and conditions tested, the simulations demonstrate that denitrification can remove up to 100% of terrestrially derived nitrate, and sulfate reduction can transform up to 8% of seawater-derived sulfate prior to discharge. Tidally driven mixing between saltwater and freshwater promotes denitrification along the boundary of the intertidal saltwater circulation cell in pore water between 1 and 10 ppt. The denitrification zone occupies on average 49% of the mixing zone. Denitrification rates are highest on the landward side of the circulation cell and decrease along circulating flow paths. Reactivity for mixing-dependent reactions increases with the size of the mixing zone and solute supply, while mixing-independent reactivity is controlled primarily by solute supply. The results provide insights into the types of beaches most efficient in altering fluxes of chemicals prior to discharge and could be built upon to help engineer beaches to enhance reactivity. The findings have implications for management to protect coastal ecosystems and the estimation of chemical fluxes to the ocean.</p>

			<p>Beach aquifers host a dynamic and reactive mixing zone between fresh and saline groundwater of contrasting origin and composition. Seawater, driven up the beachface by waves and tides, infiltrates into the aquifer and meets the seaward-discharging fresh groundwater, creating and maintaining a reactive intertidal circulation cell. Within the cell, land-derived nutrients delivered by fresh groundwater are transformed or attenuated. We investigated this process by collecting porewater samples from multi-level wells along a shore-perpendicular transect on a beach near Cape Henlopen, Delaware and analyzing solute and particulate concentrations. Porewater incubation experiments were conducted to determine rates of oxygen consumption and nitrogen gas production. A numerical model was employed to support field and laboratory interpretations. Results showed that chemically-sensitive parameters such as pH and ORP diverged from salinity distribution patterns, indicating biogeochemical reactivity within the circulation cell. The highest respiration rates were found in the landward freshwater-saltwater mixing zone, supported by high dissolved inorganic carbon. Chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton, and particulate carbon did not co-occur with the highest respiration rates, but were heterogeneously distributed in deeper and hypoxic areas of the cell. The highest rates of N2 production were also found in the mixing zone coinciding with elevated O2 consumption rates, but closer to the lower discharge point. Model results were consistent with these observations, showing heightened denitrification in the mixing zone. The results of this work emphasize the relationship between the physical flow processes of the circulation cell and its biogeochemical reactivity and highlight the environmental significance of sandy beaches.</p>

			<p>Swash-groundwater interactions affect the biogeochemistry of beach aquifers and the transport of solutes and sediment across the beachface. Improved understanding of the complex, coupled dynamics of surface and subsurface flow processes in the swash zone is required to better estimate chemical fluxes to the sea and predict the morphological evolution of beaches. Simultaneous high-frequency measurements of saturation, water table elevation, and the cross-shore locations of runup and the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated beachface (surface saturation boundary) were collected on a sandy beach to link groundwater flow dynamics with swash zone forcing. Saturation and lysimeter measurements showed the dynamic response of subsurface saturation to swash events and permitted estimation of infiltration rates. Surface and subsurface observations revealed a decoupling of the surface saturation boundary and the intersection between the water table and the beachface. Surface measurements alone were insufficient to delineate the infiltration and discharge zones, which moved independently of the surface saturation boundary. Results show for the first time the motion and areal extent of infiltration and recharge zones, and constrain the maximum size of the subaerial discharge zone over swash and tidal time scales. The width of the infiltration zone was controlled by swash processes and subaerial discharge was controlled primarily by tidal processes. These dynamics reveal the tightly coupled nature of surface and subsurface processes over multiple timescales, with implications for sediment transport and fluid and solute fluxes through the hydrologically and biogeochemically active intertidal zone of sandy beaches.

			<p>Intertidal aquifers host a reactive zone comprised of Fe mineral-coated sands where fresh and saline groundwaters mix. This zone may significantly influence the export of C, N, P, Fe, and other metals in submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Toward determining the roles of microbes in Fe and S mineralization, and the interplay of microbiology with geochemistry and physical hydrology, we conducted a biogeochemical study of pore waters at Cape Shores, Delaware. Here, fresh groundwater provides Fe(II), which precipitates as FeIIIOOH predominantly through microbial Fe(II) oxidation. Candidate division OP3 was the dominant microbial group associated with Fe(II)- and Fe(III)-rich regions of the aquifer, suggesting that this uncharacterized phylum may be involved in Fe(II) oxidation. Saline water brings O2, sulfate, and organic C into the intertidal mixing zone. Microbial reduction of sulfate produces sulfide that is transported to the Fe-mineralized zone leading to the transformation of FeOOH to Fe(II) sulfides. Microbial populations are structured by the availability of chemical species supplied along groundwater flow paths. Seasonal changes in the relative supply of fresh and saline groundwater affect solute fluxes, and therefore, microbial controls on the location and composition of the Fe-mineralized zone. Ultimately, the composition, extent, and dynamics of the Fe-mineralized zone will affect the sequestration, affinity, and residence time of solutes bound for export to coastal oceans through SGD.</p>

			<p>The biogeochemical reactivity of sandy beach aquifers is closely linked to physical flow and solute transport processes. Thus, a clearer understanding of the hydrodynamics in the intertidal zone is needed to accurately estimate chemical fluxes to the marine environment. A field and numerical modeling study was conducted over a one-year timeframe to investigate the combined effects of tidal stage, spring-neap variability in tidal amplitude, and seasonal inland water table oscillations on intertidal salinity and flow dynamics within a tide-dominated micro-tidal sandy beach aquifer. Measured and simulated salinities revealed an intertidal saline circulation cell with a structure and cross-sectional mixing zone area that varied over tidal, spring-neap and seasonal timescales. The size of the circulation cell and area of the mixing zone were shown for the first time to be most affected by seasonal water table oscillations, followed by tidal amplitude and tidal stage. The intertidal circulation cell expanded horizontally and vertically as the inland water table declined, displacing the fresh discharge zone and lower interface seaward. Over monthly spring-neap cycles, the center of the circulation cell shifted from beneath the backshore and upper beachface to the base of the beach. Salinity variations in the intertidal zone over semidiurnal tidal cycles were minimal. The dynamics of the circulation cell were similar in simulations with and without a berm. The highly transient nature of intertidal salinity over multiple time scales may have important implications for the types and rates of chemical transformations that occur in groundwater prior to discharge to the ocean.</p>

			<h2>Tidal, spring-neap, and seasonal dynamics of a saltwater-freshwater <br/>mixing zone in a beach aquifer</h2>

Proceedings of the 23rd Salt Water Intrusion Meeting, pp.159-161</h3>
			<p>The fate of chemicals discharging to the marine environment through submarine groundwater discharge may be influenced by physical flow and transport processes in the beach aquifer. A more comprehensive understanding of beach hydrodynamics over a range of time scales will thus aid in more accurately estimating chemical fluxes to coastal surface waters. The combined effects of tidal stage, tidal amplitude, and seasonal upland water table oscillations on the salinity distribution and flow dynamics in a tide-dominated sandy beach were investigated over one year using field measurements and variable-density numerical modeling. Measured and simulated results revealed an intertidal saline circulation cell with a structure and cross-sectional mixing zone area that varied over tidal, spring-neap, and seasonal time scales. Seasonal upland water table oscillations were the most important factor controlling the size of the mixing zone, followed by tidal amplitude and tidal stage. The size of the circulation cell expanded as the upland water table declined. The expansion of the cell displaced the fresh discharge zone and offshore interface seaward. The saltwater circulation cell shifted from below the upper beachface to the low tide mark in response to a change in tidal amplitude over a spring-neap cycle. Tidal stage had minimal effect on the salinity distribution in the intertidal zone over a semidiurnal tidal cycle. Seasonal variation of mean sea level did not appear to influence intertidal salinity. Salinity measurements one day following Hurricane Sandy suggest that the beach aquifer adjusted quickly after a moderate storm surge and enhanced terrestrial fresh groundwater inflow from rainfall. The highly transient nature of beach aquifer salinity over multiple time scales may have important implications for the types and rates of chemical transformations that occur in groundwater prior to discharge to the ocean.</p>
